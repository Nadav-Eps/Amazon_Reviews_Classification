# Amazon_Reviews_Classification
NLP and Deep Learning project

## Introduction
In this project the goal is to define whether a review is good or bad.
This project used a data set of over 500,000 reviews which already determined whether they are 
good or bad.
Each review had information about it such as username, profile id, product id etc.
But the goal is to determine whether itâ€™s good or bad only by the text.
