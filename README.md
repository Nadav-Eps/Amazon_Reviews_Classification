# Amazon_Reviews_Classification
NLP and Deep Learning project

## Introduction
In this project the goal is to define whether a review is good or bad.<br />
This project used a data set of over 500,000 reviews which already determined whether they are 
good or bad.<br />
Each review had information about it such as username, profile id, product id etc.<br />
But the goal is to determine whether itâ€™s good or bad only by the text.<br />
